🎥 Analyzing Viewer Trends in Sports Broadcasts Using Inferential Statistics

This project examines viewer behavior and engagement trends in sports broadcasts using inferential statistical methods. The goal is to understand what factors drive audience interaction, peak viewing times, and content preferences across different sports categories.

📊 Project Overview

Sports broadcasters need to understand when, why, and how audiences engage with their content.
Using real or simulated broadcast analytics data, this project applies statistical techniques to uncover viewer patterns and identify engagement-boosting factors.

📘 Core Statistical Methods (Inferential Statistics)



🔍 1. Hypothesis Testing

Used to examine viewer preferences and validate assumptions, such as:

Do weekend sports broadcasts attract more viewers than weekdays?

Are international matches more engaging than league games?

Are younger viewers more likely to watch on mobile devices?

📉 2. Correlation Analysis

Identifies relationships between:

Match type and viewer retention

Broadcast timing and engagement levels

Device type and watch duration

🧪 3. ANOVA / t-Tests

Used to compare viewer engagement across multiple groups:

Comparing sports categories (Cricket vs Football vs Basketball)

Comparing engagement across time slots

Comparing engagement between male vs female viewers
